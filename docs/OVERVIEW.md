# What is GraviFun?

GraviFun is a browser-based 3D sandbox where objects fall, fly, bounce — and sometimes explode — under barely-contained physics.

- 👷‍♂️ Drop vehicles, crates, and tools
- 🧲 Stack, launch, or smash anything
- 💥 Create chaos (solo or soon with friends)
- 🧪 See how far you can push gravity

There are no rules, no levels, and no goal.  
Just fun, absurdity, and a little bit of physics.
