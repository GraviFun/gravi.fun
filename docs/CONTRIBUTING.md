# Code of Conduct

GraviFun is built with playfulness and curiosity in mind — and our community should reflect that.

## Be cool

- Be respectful and kind to others
- Don’t harass or bully anyone
- No spam, hate, or drama

## Be weird (in a good way)

We encourage creative, unexpected, and strange ideas.  
Gravity may be predictable — but you don’t have to be.

Violations may lead to a warning or removal from the project.
Let’s keep things fun and safe for everyone.
